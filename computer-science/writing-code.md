# Writing Code

## Pep 20 - [The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)
The programmer's manifesto. This iconic set of principles by Tim Peters distills Python's philosophy into timeless wisdom. While born for Python, its 19 aphorisms—like "Simple is better than complex" and "Readability counts", are a universal guide for writing clean, elegant, and maintainable code in any language. Keep this one bookmarked.

## Book - [The Art of Readable Code](https://amzn.to/47WBMA7) by Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher
Write code for humans, not just computers. This is the pragmatic, universally-applicable guide to clarity that many developers wish they had first. It delivers immediate, actionable advice on naming, logic simplification, and code structure.

This is a preferred and vouched alternative over the often-debated "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin. It focuses on practical, flexible techniques over rigid dogma, making it a more effective and less opinionated resource for writing code that your teammates (and future you) will thank you for.
