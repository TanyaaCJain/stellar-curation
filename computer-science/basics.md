## To understand what is it and what we can do with it
### 1. MOOC - [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) - Harvard University (edX)
David Malan’s high-energy, entry-level course doesn’t just teach programming, it makes you think like a computer scientist. It’s famous for its engaging lectures and project-based approach that turns abstract concepts into tangible skills. Why it sticks? Malan’s legendary demos, like rifling through a giant phonebook to explain merge sort, make complex ideas unforgettable.
