# Computer Networks

## Book - [Computer Networks](https://amzn.to/3KjdhUu) by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and David J. Wetherall
A critical recommendation for a reason. Tanenbaum and Wetherall's classic doesn't just skim the surface, it maps the entire ecosystem, from the bedrock principles of computer science to the practicalities of deploying robust networks. Yes, it's dense, but that density is pure signal. It’s the comprehensive guide that turns curiosity into expertise.

## RFC Series - [RFC Editor](https://www.rfc-editor.org/)
**Read the internet's source code.** The RFC (Request for Comments) series is the canonical archive where our digital world was drafted. It started in 1969 with a single informal memo for ARPANET developers and evolved into the official record of the internet itself. This is the raw, unedited history, the original proposals and debates that became the protocols powering everything today.

For a masterclass in systems thinking, explore these documents. You're reading the original specs from the visionaries who coded our connected reality. Maintained by the RFC Editor, this living library continues to shape the future of the internet. Dive in and see how it all connects.

## Software - Wireshark
Get hands on with the software. Set up linux systems to communicate with each other and trace the packets to experience the beauty of network transmission yourself!
