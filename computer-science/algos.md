# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Book - [Introduction to Algorithms](https://amzn.to/4poTguH) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein
The legendary "CLRS." This is the definitive textbook for a reason - your university algorithms course almost certainly uses it. It's a rigorous, comprehensive deep dive into algorithm design and analysis. Consider it the essential, if dense, encyclopedia for the field.

### Website - [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en)
Watch algorithms come to life. This essential platform animates data structures and algorithms, transforming abstract concepts into clear, step-by-step visual journeys. The perfect companion to CLRS for visual learners.

### YouTube Channel - [mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool)
A beloved classic. These well-crafted tutorials break down complex topics with exceptional clarity. It's a masterclass in foundational data structures and algorithms that remains incredibly effective.

### Blog Series - [Algosaurus](http://algosaur.us/) by Radhika Ghosal
A creative gem by my childhood friend, Radhika Ghosal and another mate of hers. This hand-illustrated blog explains complex algorithms from a dinosaur's perspective, a charming and unique take that’s still a delight.

### Patterns for Problem Solving
There is a github repository that cracks the code on algorithmic problem-solving by teaching the underlying patterns. (Link currently missing, but a game-changer once found!) Idea is to find these patterns yourself and build those patterns further.
