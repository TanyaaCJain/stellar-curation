## Rituals and Practices
Incorporating daily rituals and practices can significantly enhance mental well-being and foster a positive mindset. These practices can help in managing stress, improving emotional regulation, and promoting overall mental health. Having a set morning and evening routine can provide structure to the day and help in managing stress.

### 1. Journaling
A daily practice of writing down thoughts, feelings, and experiences to gain clarity and self-awareness. It can help in processing emotions, setting goals, and tracking personal growth over time. Idea is to dump everything out of your head onto paper to declutter the mind, and then the brain eventually starts to bring order to the chaos which will be reflective in the writing as well.

### 2. Breathwork
A practice that involves controlled breathing techniques to improve mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Box breathing where you inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, and alternate nostril breathing (Pranayama) helps in calming the nervous system and reducing stress.

### 3. Acceptance
The idea is to accept situations, past events, and emotions as they are without resistance. When we fight against reality, we create more suffering for ourselves. Acceptance allows us to let go of the struggle and find peace in the present moment. This doesn't mean we approve of everything, but rather we acknowledge reality as it is. Take the lesson, cherish the happy memories, let go of the past version of yourself, and move forward.

#### Ho'oponopono prayer 
*I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you. I love you.*

This ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness can be a powerful tool for acceptance and healing. It helps in overcoming any victim mentality within oneself and taking full responsibility for one's life and experiences. By repeating this prayer when focused on a specific issue or person, one can release negative emotions and foster a sense of peace and forgiveness. Incorporate this into your journaling practice and extend each line with more personal statements if desired.

### 4. EFT Tapping
Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) or tapping is a practice that involves tapping on specific acupressure points on the body while focusing on negative emotions or physical sensations. It helps in releasing emotional blockages and promoting healing.

Suggested Resource:
[EFT Tapping by Brad Yates](https://www.youtube.com/user/BradYatesTV) on YouTube has a lot of guided tapping sessions for various issues. During the tapping, he starts with talking about the limiting beliefs on a certain topic, accepting and validating the feelings and then finally speaking positive affirmations to reprogram the mind. Has a wide range of topics covered from anxiety, stress, self worth, abundance, relationships etc. Great to speak it out loud while tapping along.

### 5. Long Walks in Nature
Spending time in nature and going for long walks can help in reducing stress, and improving overall well-being. It allows for reflection, mindfulness, and a break from the hustle of daily life. The combination of bilateral movement (walking) and sensory input (seeing, hearing) from nature without digital overload (do it without phone) has a calming effect on the brain and is profoundly grounding. Great to get your steps in as well! Start with 5 minutes, and once you start enjoying it, you would naturally want to extend the time, helping you build a sustainable habit. This also has extensively helped with regulating hormonal imbalances and improving sleep quality.

### Cold Water Therapy
Splashing cold water on face and wrists triggers the mammalian dive reflex which helps in calming the nervous system. Do it in the morning to wake up the system or anytime you feel stressed.

Taking cold showers or ice baths is believed to reduce inflammation, improve circulation, and boost mood. Yet to try this one out myself!

### 6. Meditation
A practice that involves focusing the mind and eliminating distractions to achieve a state of mental clarity and relaxation. Idea is to observe thoughts without judgment and bring attention back to the present moment. Effective when you don't wander off into your thoughts, or at least can catch yourself when you do and bring your attention back to the breath or the mantra. Starting with 5 minutes a day and gradually increasing the duration can be helpful.
