### EFT Tapping by Brad Yates
A massive library of guided Emotional Freedom Technique (tapping) sessions. The process is profound: you verbally acknowledge a limiting belief, validate the associated emotion, and use acupressure and affirmations to literally "tap out" the old pattern and "tap in" a new, empowering one. Covering everything from anxiety, self worth issues to abundance, it’s a practical tool for energetic reprogramming.

## The core philosophy

### 1. Acceptance
**Stop fighting reality.** Suffering doesn't come from pain itself, but from our resistance to it. Acceptance is the practice of acknowledging "what is"—the situation, the emotion, the past—without judgment. This isn't approval; it's a strategic surrender that disarms the struggle, allowing you to take the lesson, cherish the memory, and move forward in peace.

### 2. Detachment
**Your freedom is on the other side of expectation.** Attachment to a specific outcome in situations, people, or events, hands over your power and sets the stage for disappointment and the associated suffering. Detachment is the practice of investing your energy without being chained to the result. Care deeply, but focus on the integrity of your actions in the present, the process, rather than being fixated on the destination.

### 3. The abundance mindset
**See yourself not as an owner, but as a conduit for a limitless, universal flow.** 

This mindset shifts your relationship with everything: time, energy, opportunities, and love. They are not scarce commodities to be hoarded, but currents in a vast, circulating ecosystem where you are a willing participant.

Therefore, giving is not an act of depletion but an act of *activation*. It's a powerful declaration of trust in this infinite supply. By releasing a gift freely, without expectation or strings, you align yourself with the current, signaling your openness to receive.

This requires releasing the ego's ledger. Remember! - what you give was never truly yours to lose, and what you receive is not a debt to be repaid. Your power lies in remaining open, allowing grace to move through you. The more value you circulate, the more you become a focal point for the flow itself, unhindered by the fading myth of scarcity.
